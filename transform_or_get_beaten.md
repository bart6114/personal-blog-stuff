# Transform or Get Beaten

Big corporations that can't transform their teams into AI-native development teams are going to get beaten by smaller, leaner players. I've seen it already. A team of three or four people shipping faster and better than departments of fifty.

And the data backs this up. Something like 95% of corporate AI projects fail to demonstrate actual P&L impact. Not because the tech doesn't work, but because of everything around it. Middle management protecting headcount, procurement processes designed for a completely different era, and risk aversion baked into the culture at every level.

This transformation is going to be one of the defining challenges for large companies in the next few years. And it's going to be super hard. Not a technical problem. A cultural one. And cultural problems are always the hardest.

*Focus on the incentive problem. Everybody feels we need to invest in AI, everybody hears the stories about how you can be way more efficient. But what actually happens is managers resort to stick-over-carrot: "if you don't use AI, you get less bonus." So people get a Copilot cursor, get told "now you need to use this," and everybody hates it. That's not transformation, that's compliance theater. Dig into why top-down mandates fail and what actually works.*
