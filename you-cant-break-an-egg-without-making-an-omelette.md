# You Can't Break an Egg Without Making an Omelette

When you're a kid, adults love asking you what you want to be when you grow up. Firefighter. Astronaut. Veterinarian. You throw something out there, they smile, and everyone moves on. The unspoken assumption is that at some point, the answer stops being a performance and starts being real. You just *know*.

I'm in my late thirties. I built a company, grew it, sold it. And I still don't know.

A few years ago, I sold [Dataroots](https://dataroots.io), the company I founded. By most measures, it was a successful exit. The kind of thing people congratulate you for at dinners and on LinkedIn. And don't get me wrong, I'm proud of it. Building Dataroots was one of the hardest, most rewarding things I've ever done. But here's the thing nobody really prepares you for: what happens after.

When you're deep in the trenches of building something, hiring, selling, firefighting, shipping, the company becomes everything. It fills your calendar, your headspace, your identity. At some point, without you noticing, the project starts to feel like your *purpose*. It creeps in. If you'd asked me at the time whether Dataroots was my purpose, I would have said no, of course not. But when something takes up that much of your time and energy, it becomes all-encompassing whether you label it that way or not. It doesn't have to be a company, by the way. It can be a lot of things in life. But for me, it was this. You wake up in the morning and you know exactly why. The mission, the team, the next milestone. It's all-consuming, and in a weird way, that's comforting.

And there's something else people underestimate. When you're that deep in, your personal life and your professional life get completely entangled. Your friends are your colleagues. Your social life happens at work events, team dinners, offsites. Your network and your org chart start to look suspiciously similar. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In a lot of ways it's a good thing. It means you're building with people you genuinely care about. But it also means that when the company changes hands, you're not just losing a job or a project. You're losing a piece of your social world too. And nobody warns you about that part.

Then the deal closes, the papers are signed, and it's gone. Not violently. More like a slow fade. You're still involved for a bit, but it's not yours anymore. And that's when the quiet part hits you.

It was never your purpose. It was a goal.

That distinction messed me up more than I expected. Because when you confuse a goal for a purpose, achieving the goal doesn't bring clarity. It brings a vacuum.

After Dataroots, I told myself I'd take some time. Breathe. Travel. And, because I'm wired this way, do some serious running. I'm big into endurance sports. Ultramarathons, long trail runs, the kind of thing where you voluntarily wake up at 5 AM on a Saturday and call it fun. The plan was to lean into that. Fill the space with miles instead of meetings.

Then I got injured. Badly enough that I'm still dealing with it now.

And that's where things got really interesting. Because running, for me, was always a pressure valve. When your brain is spinning, your legs can take over. When nothing makes sense, at least the trail does. Take that away, and you're just... sitting with yourself.

No company to run. No miles to log. Just the uncomfortable reality that I'm a grown adult who still doesn't have an answer to that question from childhood.

At first, that felt like failure. Like I'd somehow missed a step. Everyone else seems to have figured it out, or at least they're better at pretending. But the more I sat with it, the more I started to think that maybe confusing goals for purpose is the actual trap. Maybe "what do you want to be when you grow up" was always the wrong question.

I've since started building something new. A venture that's AI-native from the ground up, and honestly, it's one of the most exciting things I've worked on. The technical challenges are real, the strategic positioning is fascinating, and the market timing feels right. I'm genuinely having fun with it.

But I see it differently now. It's a project. A really good one, hopefully a great one. But it's not *me*. It's not my reason for being. And I think that's healthier. Because when Dataroots was everything, losing it felt like losing myself. I don't want to make that trade again.

The injury helped me see that, ironically. Standing still when all you want to do is move has a way of clarifying things. You realize how much of your identity you'd outsourced to *doing*. The company, the running, the next thing on the list. Strip all of that away and the question becomes: who are you when you're not performing?

I still don't have a clean answer. And I'm starting to think that's okay.

So here's where I've landed, for now. Purpose isn't a destination. It's not a company you build or a finish line you cross. It's more like a direction. Something you feel in motion, not something you arrive at. The goals along the way are important. They give you structure, momentum, something to aim for. But they're not the thing itself.

I broke the egg. Sold the company, got hurt, lost my usual escapes. And now I'm making the omelette. Figuring out what comes next, one day at a time. It's messy. It's uncertain. But it's honest.

And honestly? I think the kid who couldn't answer "what do you want to be when you grow up" was onto something. Maybe the point was never to know. Maybe the point is to keep asking.

Oh, and the title is of course an homage to Dave Farber. RIP.
